In the real world, protocol often refers to a code of conduct or a form of etiquette. People must follow certain rules of behaviour, ceremony etc. They also have to know what is expected of them in any particular situation to ensure communication wihout conflicts. The same requirements are expected when they interact with people from other countries and cultures, making sure that they do not offend anybody due to unfamiliarity of local customs. In simple words - protocols are some kind of unwritten rules of society.

All in all, social networking and networking in context of computers are very similar. They define set of rules and procedures that enable devices and systems to communicate. Despite that PCs and laptops do not have to worry about making a faux pas, they strictly have to ensure that all the devices on the network are in agreement about how to communicate with each other.

> Protocol is set of rules algorithms, messages and other defined mechanisms which is governing communication between entities at the same layer. For example Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is responsible for specific way of communication on layer 4 in the OSI model. Therefore all hosts must implement TCP to utilize it properly.

Despite above definition, term `protocol` often refers to different concepts of networking, eg: protocol suites (set of protocols), MS Windows Protocols.
